A method is a pre-defined set of instructions. Methods are declared within a class.
Java provides some pre-defined methods available to all classes, but we can create our own as well.

new method code

class Dog {
  
  int age;

	public Dog(int dogsAge) {
    
  	age = dogsAge;
    
  }
  
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("Woof!");

}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    Dog spike = new Dog(5);

	}

}
